# My Docker Project

This project contains a Docker Compose configuration file and documentation for setting up a Node-RED container.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

### Starting the Node-RED Container

To start the Node-RED container, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.

### Accessing Node-RED

Once the container is running, you can access the Node-RED interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:1880`.

### Stopping the Node-RED Container

To stop the Node-RED container, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command will stop and remove the container.

## Configuration

The Docker Compose configuration file `docker-compose.yml` defines the services, networks, and volumes for the Docker project. Here is an overview of the configuration:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  node-red:
    image: nodered/node-red
    ports:
      - 1880:1880
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

The `node-red` service uses the `nodered/node-red` image and exposes port `1880`. It also creates a volume named `data` that maps to the `./data` directory in the project.
